- Incomplete source of funds

**b) Sanctions Screening**
- Transaction to sanctioned country
- Involvement of sanctioned entities
- Blocked transaction attempts

**c) Currency Compliance**
- Transactions with restricted currencies
- Invalid currency conversion rates
- Suspicious forex transactions

**Expected Results**:
- Cross-border rules enforced consistently
- Required documentation validated
